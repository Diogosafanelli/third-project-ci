 With the ATM bank project you will have access to your bank account being able to perform all the most common services of a common bank such as checking your balance, making a deposit, withdrawing money

The project is deployed on Heroku and is strictly terminal-based for user interaction

 ## UX/UI Design
 <hr>

 ### Strategy

#### Site owner goals

- ATM bank is a project for those who love money, you will have the experience of having an ATM inside your home, being able to do your banking transactions in the comfort of your home, of course this is just a fun experience of how to deal with an atm inside your home

#### User stories

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of the website, so I can know if it's of interest to me.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate the site/ATM, so I don't lose enthusiasm for using the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to learn something new, so I fulfill the objective that brought me to the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to restart/quit the ATM, if it is in my interest to start again for some reason

### Scope

- For the ATM Bank I have planned the following features.
  - Use of the python language efficiently to make the ATM don't show any problems.
  - Through the terminal-based, display as clearly as possible the ATM dynamic.
  - Use technologies and tools that improve site development and performance.


Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **March 14, 2023**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
